The basic problem is shown in the following figure, which represents light of a given wavelength $\lambda$ passing through two slits separated by a distance $d$.
The distance to the screen is $L$.
In this lab experiment you will **measure the intensity at a position $y$** along the screen, which corresponds to a scattering angle $\theta$.

```{figure} 214_prelab_1_fig_1.png
Fig. 1
```

As shown in class, the **phase difference** between the two light beams at position $y$ is:

$$
\phi = 2\pi(\delta/\lambda)$$ where $$\delta = d\sin\theta \approx d(y/L)
$$

is the path difference between the two beams.
From phasor analysis, if the intensity arriving at the screen from each slit is $I_1$, the total intensity at $y$ from both slits is:

$$
I = 4I_1\cos^2\frac{\phi}{2} = 4I_1\cos^2\left(\frac{\pi d}{\lambda L}y\right)
$$

The more general form for the interference pattern from $N$ slits is:

$$
I = I_1\left(\frac{\sin(N\phi/2)}{\sin(\phi/2)}\right)^2.
$$

### 1.

**Show that this reduces to the 2-slit case when $N = 2$.**

When we consider the **diffraction** of light through a single slit of width a, we find that the single-slit intensity, $I_1$, in the above equation is not simply a constant but also depends on angle.
The **single-slit pattern** looks like the following plot:

### 2.

Calculate the position of the first diffraction minimum assuming a laser wavelength of 633 nm, a slit width of 20 $\mu$m, and a screen distance of 1 m.

$$
y = \_\_\_\_
$$

**Answer**:
```






```

**!!DO NOT FORGET TO INDICATE UNITS FOR ALL NUMERICAL ANSWER YOU PROVIDE!!**

So the net result due to both **interference and diffraction** is the product of the curves in Figs. 2 and 3 (see also 214 Lecture 3):

You should be able to tell what the ratio $d/a$ is by just looking at the above pattern.

$$
d/a = \_\_\_\_
